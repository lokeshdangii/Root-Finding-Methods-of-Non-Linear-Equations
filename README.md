# Root Finding Methods of Non-Linear Equations

This repository contains Python implementations of various root-finding methods for solving non-linear equations. Each method is implemented in a separate Python script.

## Root Finding Methods Included

1. **Bisection Method**: The bisection method is a simple and robust iterative technique for finding the roots of a continuous function within a specified interval.

   - File: `BisectionMethod.py`
   - Usage: Run this script to find the root of an equation using the bisection method.

2. **Newton-Raphson Method**: The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative numerical technique used to find the roots of a function by using its derivative.

   - File: `NewtonRaphson.py`
   - Usage: Execute this script to calculate the root of an equation using the Newton-Raphson method.

3. **Regula Falsi Method**: The regula falsi method is a bracketing technique that iteratively narrows down the interval containing the root.

   - File: `RegulaFalsi.py`
   - Usage: Run this script to find the root of an equation using the regula falsi method.

4. **Secant Method**: The secant method is an iterative numerical technique similar to the Newton-Raphson method but does not require calculating the derivative.

   - File: `SecantMethod.py`
   - Usage: Execute this script to compute the root of an equation using the secant method.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Root-Finding-Methods-of-Non-Linear-Equations.git


2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```shell
    cd Root-Finding-Methods-of-Non-Linear-Equations

3. Choose the method you want to use and open the corresponding Python script.

4. Modify the script to define the equation you want to find the root of and adjust any other parameters if needed.

5. Run the Python script:

    ```
    python BisectionMethod.py
    ```
    Replace BisectionMethod.py with the appropriate script name.
